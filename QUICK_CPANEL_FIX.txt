## Immediate Actions

### 1. Run Diagnostic (RIGHT NOW)
```
https://your-domain.com/cpanel-diagnose.php
```
Save output. Check for ✗ (red) items.

### 2. Fix Permissions (5 minutes)
Via cPanel File Manager:
- Select `public_html` → Change Permissions to `755`
- Select all files → Change Permissions to `644`

Via SSH:
```bash
chmod -R 755 ~/public_html
find ~/public_html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

### 3. Check .htaccess
- Should exist in `public_html`
- Permissions: `644`
- No syntax errors

### 4. Test Immediately
```
https://domain.com/cpanel-diagnose.php
```
